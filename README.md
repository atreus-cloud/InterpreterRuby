# InterpreterRuby
A Simple Interpreter for Ruby, coded in Java

In this project, I will be attempting to code a Interpreter for Ruby in Java. My code should take simple ruby code in .txt file scripts, and return the correct output.

# The workings of the code:

-Lexer: Converts input into tokens.
- Parser: Builds an AST from tokens.
- AST Classes: Represents different types of statements and expressions.
- Interpreter (Visitor): Executes parsed statements.
